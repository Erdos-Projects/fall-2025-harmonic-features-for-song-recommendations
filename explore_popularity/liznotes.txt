Exploring popularity as a target

1. Target options: Spotify popularity score (continuous), Billboard top 100 appearance (categorical, hit vs. non hit analysis), weeks on Billboard chart, peak position on Billboard chart
    Billboard limitations/questions: 
        - Billboard 100 would be a very small subset of Chordonomicon dataset
        - Do we limit this secondary analysis to a Chrodonomicon subset that are above a certain popularity score?
        - Do we use weekly charts dataset (rwd-billboard-data/data-out/hot-100-current.csv) or top 100 year end dataset (Kaggle, even less songs would make it)
        - Bias toward American music, may not be a fair target for world music (outside of UK)
    Another option: for songs that qualify, compare how harmony predicts decade vs. billboard features 

2. Initial insights:
    1. What percentage of Chordonomicon songs are even represented on top 100 (esp since Chrodonomicon excludes songs with a few chords)
    2. Does Spotify popularity score match up with Billboard top 100 appearance (how related are these targets?)
    3. Decade insights from Billboard:
        - Does artist diversity (# of different artists on chart) change across decades
            - For each year, get the # of different artists that appeared at least once 
        - Does time on chart distribution change across decades (do songs stick around more in certain decades vs. others)
            - Get max wks_on_chart for each song
        - Does song range of peak position change across decades (ie, do songs travel up the list slowly or just stay around one spot)

3. To Do
    1. Billboard list is names only. From Iliyana's output match Spotify ID's to Artist/Song names 
    2. Build code that takes in chordonomicon songlist. If song is on chart (with song and artist name), add True or False to is_hit column, if True, add max weeks and peak position data to columns
