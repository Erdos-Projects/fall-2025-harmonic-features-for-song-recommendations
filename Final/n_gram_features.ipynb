    "A **raw chord** is a musical chord, represented either as a string (e.g. 'C' or 'Amin'), or as a binary vector of lenght 12 ('C' corresponds to $[1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]$). The Chordonomicon dataset represents chords within songs as string labels, and provides the file \"chords_mapping.csv\" for converting from a string to vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the space of raw chords is $X = \\{0,1\\}^{12}$. The cyclic group $G = \\mathbb{Z}/12 \\mathbb{Z}$ acts on this set by cyclically permuting vectors, which corresponds musically to transposition. Two chords are **harmonically equivalent** of they are in the same orbit of this group action, so the set of chords up to harmonic equivalence is the quotient space $X/G$. Musically speaking, two chords are harmonically equivalent if one of them is a transposition of the other. More generally, an $n$-gram is a finite sequence in $X$, and $G$ acts entry-wise on these sequences, and two $n$-grams are harmonically equivalent if they lie in the same $G$-orbit. The general space of $n$-grams up to equivalence is\n",

    "This leaves the question of how to pick which $x \\in \\displaystyle \\bigcup_{n \\ge 1} (X^n/G)$ are most useful features for genre prediction. We have made this determination as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A single musical \"phrase\" or \"idea\" is usually not longer than 5 chords, and often shorter, so we'll only consider $1 \\le n \\le 5$.\n",
    "* If a single model utilizes $n$-grams of multiple lengths, say $n=3$ and $n=4$, then there are dependency issues between features. For example, any song containing the $4$-gram 'C,F,G,C' also contains the $3$-grams 'C,F,G' and 'F,G,C'. While this isn't literally collinearity between features, it is a significant amount of redundant information.\n",
    "* Generalizing the previous idea, if shorter sequences do contain useful information about genre, then that information would also likely be captured by looking at longer sequences. More specifically, if there is useful information to be captured about genre with single chords or pairs of chords, then that information would also be captured by looking at $3$-grams or longer. So modeling with $1$-grams and $2$-grams seems not that useful.\n",
    "\n",
